# Personal Development Dashboard

---

This project aims to create an **AI-powered personal dashboard** designed to help users monitor and enhance various aspects of their lives, including **fitness, finances, mental well-being** (meditation, prayer, journaling), and **daily routines**. The system will integrate with **Google Calendar** and, eventually, **Apple Health** to automatically sync health and activity data. It will also support manual data input through a clean **React web interface**.

While initially developed for personal use, the dashboard is built with **scalability** in mind for future users. The design will feature a **white/grey/black color scheme with orange accents**, prioritizing ease of use, clarity, and insightful visualizations.
